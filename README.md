# ROTTR-DRM-Loader

This is a very minimal port of a feature from [TRAE-Menu-Hook](https://github.com/TheIndra55/TRAE-menu-hook) for Rise of the Tomb Raider which allows you to load DRM files on fly outside the Tiger archive.

## Build

Make sure to clone with submodules and that you have [premake5](https://premake.github.io/), next run

Now open the solution file and build the project.

## Usage

Start the game and then inject the dll with cheatengine at the NxApp startup screen or ingame.
